This weeks assignment was to build a 'happy thoughts' app fetching and posting data to an API.

I started out by thinking about the content, trying to figure out how many components I should create. I decided I needed at least two (one for the form, another one for the messages). After creating them and working for a while the content started adding up, so I created a third component acting as a "message board" for the form and messages. I also added a header component to improve the overall appearence of the app.

Technologies: CSS, JSX, React, API.
